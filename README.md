# User Stories :information_desk_person: :computer:

## What is it? :speech_balloon:

- A short, simple description of a product feature.
- Told from the perspective of the person who wants that feature.
- Told as a potential and/or existing user of a product or service.
- Used to define the product backlog in an Agile Development workflow.
- The product backlog is a collection of user stories that drives feature development for a product or service.

## How do you write them? :pencil2:
Three parts:
- The persona :ok_woman:
- The feature :hammer:
- The need satisfied by the feature :exclamation:

Template:

"As a __<USER_ROLE>__ I want __<WHAT_OR_FEATURE>__ so that __<WHY_OR_SATISFY A NEED>__"

Example Story: **Airbnb**
- "**As an user**, I want **to search for a destination** so I can **book accommodation in a foreign city**".

## What is an Epic? :speech_balloon:
- An epic is a very big user story.
- An epic will likely contain many other smaller user stories.

Example Epic:
- "I want to find a holiday destinations and travel abroad."

Example Epics:
1. "**As an user** I want **to discover new and interesting destinations**."
2. "**As an user**, I want **to search for a destination** so I can **book accommodation in a foreign city**."
3. "**As an user**, I want **to be able to find a new experience**."

1. "**As an user**, I want **to be recommended experiences based on my interests**."
2. "**As an user**, I want **to browse activities to create a new experience**."

##### Other epic example:
